Veilig Op School(VOS)

This project has been final major project. The project was to create an API for emergency procedures. An example of a procedure will be ‘what to do in case of a fire outbreak’. Also important in the program was that there would be made use of the Google Authentication method. The school creates a Google login for each student.

For each procedure that is called there will be a check to see if a user is know and what his role is. Depending on this you will see other steps that needs to be performed. 

There will be also 3 kind of accounts, a normal user who can view certain procedures, an editor who can create, update or remove proceders and an admin who can do everything else like creating new users and so on.

There wont be any views in this repository, this was an assignment of other studens who had to write an IPhone app or an Android App which would make use of the API.
